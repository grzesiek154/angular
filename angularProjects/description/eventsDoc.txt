-Input and Output properties
An Input property is a settable property annotated with an @Input decorator. Values flow into the property when it is data bound with a property binding

An Output property is an observable property annotated with an @Output decorator. The property almost always returns an Angular EventEmitter. Values flow out of the component as events bound with an event binding.

You can only bind to another component or directive through its Input and Output properties.
