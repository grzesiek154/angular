Each component is the child of another component
most components have a parent(except root)
Components should be not to small or to big - it should do one functionality
Logic shoud be put in SERVICES
Components should be just classes that delegate logic and display info



Comunication mechanizm between parent and child component:

-@Input()
data is shared from parent to child, not the other way aroun

<app-note *ngFor="let note of notes" [note]="note"></app-note>

@Input() note: Note;

-@Output()
children can share events using @Output()
