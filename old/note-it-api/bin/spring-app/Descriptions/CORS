Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security concept that allows restricting the resources implemented in web browsers. It prevents the JavaScript code producing or consuming the requests against different origin.

For example, your web application is running on 8080 port and by using JavaScript you are trying to consuming RESTful web services from 9090 port. Under such situations, you will face the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing security issue on your web browsers.

Two requirements are needed to handle this issue âˆ’

RESTful web services should support the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

RESTful web service application should allow accessing the API(s) from the 8080 port.
